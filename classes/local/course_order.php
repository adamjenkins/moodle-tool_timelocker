/**
 * Orders course modules the way they appear on the course page.
 *
 * modinfo lists modules section by section in section-number order. That is
 * not page order once a course uses subsections: a subsection's content lives
 * in a delegated section numbered after every listed section, but the page
 * shows it inline, where the subsection module sits. This walks the listed
 * sections and descends into each delegated section at its module's position.
 *
 * Core's course_modinfo::sort_cm_array() does the same, but only from Moodle
 * 5.0.3 (absent from the v5.0.0-v5.0.2 tags), and this plugin supports 5.0.0.
